'''✨ Using single and double quotes in a string literals  ✨'''

dict = {"a": "Mark", "b": "Canada", "c": 22}


# In each case mentioned above Python interpreter
# throws the same "SyntaxError".
# It means not only for the dictionary but this
# behaviour is generally the same for using any
# string literals with f-strings.


# print(f"He said, "he is ok."")
# print(f'What's your name.')
# print(f'My name is {dict['a']})
