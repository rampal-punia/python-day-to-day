# A few advanced concepts in Python

Decorators: A way to modify or extend the behavior of functions in a non-invasive way.

Generators and Iterators: Tools for creating iterators and working with lazy evaluation to save memory.

Metaclasses: A way to create classes programmatically, and to modify their behavior.

Context Managers: A way to manage resources, such as file handles or network connections, using the "with" statement.

Coroutines: A way to implement cooperative multitasking using generator functions.

Type Hints: A way to add type information to your code, to make it easier to maintain and understand.

Async programming: A way to write asynchronous, non-blocking code using async and await keywords.

Multiple inheritance and Mixins: A way to achieve inheritance from multiple classes, to reuse code and build complex class hierarchies.

Threading: allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a process. It's used for light-weight tasks that need to run in parallel, such as UI updates, network communication, and I/O operations.

Multiprocessing: allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space and CPU resources. It's used for heavyweight tasks that need to run in parallel, such as large data processing, machine learning, and scientific computing.
