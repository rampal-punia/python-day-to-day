In Python, the following types are generally considered "callable":

User defined Functions and lambdas
Built-in Functions
Built-in Methods
Methods
Classes (to create instances of the class)
Class instances that define a __call__() method

Note that not all types can be called in Python. Some types, like integers, floats, and tuples, are not callable.
