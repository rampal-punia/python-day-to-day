'''✨ More than a bracket () a comma ',' decides
a tuple in Python ✨
'''

# Question:
t = (1, 2, 3)

# What would be the output of this print statement
print(type(t))

# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Correct

# Now
t = 1, 2, 3

# What would be the output of this print statement
print(type(t))

# Output: <class 'tuple'>

# And also
t = 1,

print(type(t))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>

# I hope you were not expecting the class int here!
