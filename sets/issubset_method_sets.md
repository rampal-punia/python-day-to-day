# issubset Method of Python Sets

The `issubset()` method in Python sets is used to check whether one set is a subset of another or not. It returns `True` if all the elements of the calling set are present in the passed set, otherwise `False`.

In other words, it checks if every element in the calling set is also present in the passed set.

Syntax:

```python
set_a.issubset(set_b)
```

Here `set_a` is the calling set and `set_b` is the set to be checked against.

Example:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(set_a.issubset(set_b)) # Output: True
```

In this example, `set_a` is a subset of `set_b` because all the elements of `set_a` `(1, 2, and 3)` are present in `set_b`. Therefore, `issubset()` returns `True`.

Another example where `set_a` is not a subset of `set_b`:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_b = {1, 2, 3}

print(set_a.issubset(set_b)) # Output: False
```

In this example, set_a contains an additional element `4` which is not present in `set_b`. Therefore, it returns False.

Note: If the calling set is equal to the passed set, `issubset()` returns `True`. This is because every element in the calling set is also present in the passed set, and vice versa.

For example:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {1, 2, 3}

print(set_a.issubset(set_b)) # Output: True
```

The `<=` operator can also be used to check whether one set is a subset of another set or not, just like the `issubset()` method. So, it also returns `True` if all the elements of the calling set are present in the passed set, otherwise False.

Syntax of the subset operator `<=`:

```python
set_a <= set_b
```

Example:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3}
set_b = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(set_a <= set_b) # Output: True
```

Similarly, we can check the `<=` operator with other examples used above with `issubset()` method.

The `issubset()` method can also take an iterable as an argument in addition to a set. This can be helpful when comparing two data structures that are not necessarily set. For example:

```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
list_b = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]

print(set_a.issubset(list_b))  # Output: True
```

In this example, `set_a` is a subset of `list_b` as all the elements of `set_a` are present in `list_b`.

In conclusion, issubset() method is useful when you need to check if all elements of one set are present in another set or not. It returns a Boolean value True or False depending on whether the calling set is a subset of the passed set or not. The <= operator can be used to achieve the same task as the issubset method.
