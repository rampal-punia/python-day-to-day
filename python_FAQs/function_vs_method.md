# Functions Vs Methods In Python

ðŸ™‹"What is the difference between functions and methods in Python?"

ðŸ‘‰This is considered as a Beginner's Question.

And the simple and straight answer given to this question is:

|Functions|Methods|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Functions are defined independently, outside of a class.|Methods are declared inside a class.|
|Functions are function objects.|Methods are bound methods of a class.|

ðŸ”¥But, but, but... ðŸ”¥

âš¡Here is a catch!!!

I am not saying it is completely wrong, but it is not complete. First, let us see the support for the above explanation:

```python
# Declaring a function greet_outer "outside a class"
def greet_outer(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Declaring a function greet_inner "inside a class"
    def greet_inner(self):
        return f"Hello {self.name}"


# Instantiate a class
p1 = Person("John")

# Print both the objects
print(p1.greet_inner)
print(greet_outer)
```

Output:

```bash
# We get the output supporting out explanation.
<bound method Person.greet_inner of <__main__.Person object at 0x7f8df3e57c40>>
<function greet_outer at 0x7f8df3eb6310>
```

## Let's check them in more detail

The second explanation, "Functions are function objects, whereas methods are bound methods of a class", looks more technical, so let's check it out first.

In the example below:

```python
# Declaring a function greet_outer "outside a class"
def greet_outer(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Declaring a function greet_inner "inside a class"
    def greet_inner(self):
        return f"Hello {self.name}"

# <------------Changes Here------------>

# Instead of instantiating a class and then calling greet_inner,
# call it directly from class. And check the output:
print(Person.greet_inner)
print(greet_outer)
```

Output:

```bash
# Both are function objects here.
<function Person.greet_inner at 0x7f33970910d0>
<function greet_outer at 0x7f33971fc310>
```

For the first explanation, "Functions are defined independently, outside of the class and methods are declared inside the class.", Let's check the example below:

```python
# Declaring a function greet_outer "outside a class"
def greet_outer(self, name):
    print(self)
    return f"Hello {name}"


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Declaring a function greet_inner "inside a class"
    def greet_inner(self):
        return f"Hello {self.name}"

# <------------Changes Here------------>

# And now, assigning the greet_outer to the Person class.
Person.greet_outer = greet_outer

# Instantiate a class
p1 = Person("John")

print(p1.greet_inner)
print(p1.greet_outer)
```

## Output

```bash
# Both are bound methods here.
<bound method Person.greet_inner of <__main__.Person object at 0x7fd7a7614340>>
<bound method greet_outer of <__main__.Person object at 0x7fd7a7614340>>
```

The `greet_outer` is defined outside the class and still can be used as a bound method. Now the question arises, "Is our explanation given above about `functions and methods` correct completely?"

Let's check what we can add here:

If a function bound to a class is called by an instance of that class and passes that instance, as the first argument to that function, then only that function is called a method of that class instance.

Therefore, function and method are not directly dependent on where they are declared, and a function object can be called a method object by assigning it to a class.

I am still open to the correction of the statement above...
