# Useful methods of collections module

The collections module in Python provides alternatives to built-in types that can be more efficient than the alternatives for specific use cases. Here are some of the important methods from the collections module:

namedtuple() - Returns a new tuple subclass with named fields.
deque() - Returns a new double-ended queue object.
Counter() - Returns a new dictionary-like object that counts occurrences of elements.
defaultdict() - Returns a new dictionary-like object with a default value for any keys that don't exist.
OrderedDict() - Returns a new dictionary-like object that maintains the order of the keys.
ChainMap() - Returns a new chain map object that groups multiple dictionaries into one.
UserDict() - Returns a new dictionary-like object that can be subclassed to provide a dictionary interface.
These are just a few examples of the useful methods available in the collections module. The best one to use depends on the specific use case and requirements.
