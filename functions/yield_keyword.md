# Yield keyword argument in Python

In Python, the yield keyword is used in the context of generators.

A generator is a type of iterable, like a list or a tuple, but unlike those objects, it doesn't hold its entire sequence in memory at once.

Instead, it computes its values on-the-fly as they are needed, one at a time, through the use of the `yield` keyword.

In other words, When a generator function is called, it doesn't execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns an iterator object that represents the execution of the function. The iterator can then be used to generate the sequence of values as needed.

The yield keyword is used in a generator function to pause the execution of the function and return a value to the caller.

When the generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the sequence of values produced by the generator.

Each time the generator's `next()` method is called, the function resumes execution from where it left off, and continues until it hits the next yield statement. At that point, it yields the value and pauses again.

Here is an example of a generator function that uses the yield keyword:

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1
```

This function returns a generator object that can be used to count down from a given number. Each time the yield keyword is encountered, the current value of n is returned and the function is paused. The next time the __next__() method is called on the generator object, the function resumes execution with the current value of n decremented by one.

```python
>>> c = countdown(5)
>>> next(c)
5
>>> next(c)
4
>>> next(c)
3
>>> next(c)
2
>>> next(c)
1
>>> next(c)
StopIteration
```

In this example, `my_generator()` is a function that takes an integer `n` and generates a sequence of integers from 0 to n-1 using a for loop and the `yield` keyword.

When the generator is created with `my_generator(5)`, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the sequence of integers. Each call to `next(gen)` returns the next integer in the sequence, until the end of the sequence is reached and a `StopIteration` exception is raised.

## Sending a value back into the generator

The yield keyword can also be used to send a value back into the generator when it resumes execution. This is done by calling the generator's `send()` method with a value as its argument.

The yield statement then evaluates to this value, and the generator resumes execution until it hits the next yield statement or the end of the function.

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of the send() method:

```python
def my_generator():
    value = yield
    yield value * 2

gen = my_generator()
next(gen)
print(gen.send(10))  # 20
```

The yield keyword can also be used to receive values from the caller, allowing the generator function to be used as a coroutine. For example, consider the following generator function that receives values from the caller and generates a sequence of values based on those inputs:

```python
def generate_squares():
    while True:
        x = yield
        yield x**2
```

When this function is called, it returns an iterator object that can be used to generate the sequence of squares of input values:

```python
>>> iterator = generate_squares()
>>> next(iterator)
>>> iterator.send(2)
4
>>> iterator
```

In Python, the yield keyword is used to create generator functions, which can generate a sequence of values on-the-fly, rather than returning a single value and exiting.

The send() method is used to send a value back into the generator function at the point where yield was last used. This allows for two-way communication between the caller and the generator, and can be used to control the generator's behavior dynamically.

The send() method takes a single argument, which is the value to be sent back into the generator. Here is an example of how send() can be used:

```python
def my_generator():
    while True:
        x = yield
        print(f"Received value: {x}")

g = my_generator()
next(g)  # need to call next to advance the generator to the first yield
g.send(1)  # send a value of 1 into the generator
g.send(2)  # send a value of 2 into the generator
```

In this example, the my_generator() function is an infinite loop that yields control back to the caller using yield. The next() function is called once to advance the generator to the first yield. Then, send() is called twice to send values of 1 and 2 back into the generator, which are then printed out.

One thing to note is that the first call to send() must pass in None as its argument, since there is no previous yield to send a value back to. This is equivalent to calling next() on the generator.

Additionally, the value passed to send() is received by the yield expression as its return value. In the example above, the value x is assigned the value passed to send() on each iteration of the loop.

In summary, the send() method of the yield keyword allows for two-way communication between the caller and the generator, enabling dynamic control of the generator's behavior.
